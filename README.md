## Introduction
Building a scalable Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) solution is critical to ensuring fine-grained and flexible access control in modern applications. This repository explores the implementation of ABAC and how it outperforms traditional role-based approaches by allowing dynamic policy enforcement based on user, resource, and environmental attributes.

## Understanding Access Control
Access control prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized users interact with sensitive data. As applications grow in complexity, enforcing permissions cleanly and efficiently becomes a challenge.

**Key Terminologies:**
- **Authentication (AUTHN):** Verifies a user's identity.
- **Authorization (AUTHZ):** Determines what resources a user can access.
- **Permissions:** Define specific actions allowed within the scope of authorization.
- **Access Control:** Measures in place to enforce authorization policies.

## Multi-Layered Access Control
A robust access control system should be enforced at multiple layers:
1. **Network Layer:** Firewalls, VPNs - control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
2. **Endpoint Layer:** Endpoint Detection and Response - EDR,  Mobile Device Management- MDM, ensure only compliant devices can access your application.
3. **API Layer:** JWTs, API keys, API gateways authenticate and authorize the caller and enforce policies e.g. rate limiting, IP Whitelisting.
4. **Application Layer:** Core business logic for authorization (**focus of this repo**).
5. **Data Layer:** Database-level permissions, row/column-level security.

## Access Control Models
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC assigns permissions based on predefined roles. Example roles in a blog application:
- **Admin:** Full control.
- **Editor:** Edit/approve posts in assigned categories.
- **Author:** Create/edit own posts.
- **Guest:** View public posts.

RBAC is simple but becomes inefficient as role complexity increases (role explosion).

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
ABAC evaluates access dynamically using:
- **User Attributes** (e.g., role, department, clearance level).
- **Resource Attributes** (e.g., owner, category, status).
- **Action Attributes** (e.g., read, write, execute).
- **Environment Attributes** (e.g., time of access, location).

Example: A publisher can publish only approved posts in assigned categories during business hours.

### Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)
ReBAC grants access based on relationships (e.g., a user can edit only their own posts). Useful for social networking applications.

## Why Choose ABAC?
- Handles **dynamic and complex** access scenarios.
- **Scales efficiently**, reducing administrative overhead.
- **Eases audits** by making access rules explicit.
- **Supports fine-grained access control** beyond RBAC’s static scopes.

## ABAC in Depth
### Core Components
ABAC policies are defined by logical rules combining:
- **User Attributes:** e.g., department, clearance level.
- **Resource Attributes:** e.g., category, owner.
- **Action Attributes:** e.g., create, read, delete.
- **Environment Attributes:** e.g., time, location.

### How ABAC Works
Scenario:
- **User:** Sam, a Publisher.
- **Resource:** Blog post.
- **Action:** Publish.
- **Conditions:** Only within assigned categories, during business hours.

If Sam changes roles or categories, access updates automatically—no manual intervention needed.

## Defining ABAC Policies
Security administrators, IAM teams, and business managers define ABAC policies. 
Their responsibilities include analyzing business needs, risk management, regulatory compliance, and ensuring that users have the right level of access to resources. 
They translate security requirements into policies based on the different attributes and conditions specific to the organization.

Policies enforce compliance and align with business requirements.


## Where to Enforce ABAC
ABAC should be enforced at both the **front-end** and **back-end**.

### Front-End Enforcement
- **Instant feedback:** UI adjusts dynamically.
- **Smarter UX:** Hides unauthorized actions.
- **Reduces unnecessary backend calls.**
- **Security layer:** Prevents accidental exposure of restricted features.

### Back-End Enforcement
- **Prevents bypassing front-end restrictions.**
- **Ensures secure data access at the source.**
- **Applies consistent rules across APIs and services.**

## Conclusion
ABAC is a scalable, flexible, and dynamic access control model suitable for complex applications. It overcomes RBAC’s limitations, allowing organizations to enforce security policies that adapt to changing user attributes, environments, and business needs.
